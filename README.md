##### Technologies

  - `Webpack` - as a module budler. Great flexible tool which allows us to maintain whole development and build process,
  - `React` - as a render library. It's a very suitable tool for applications and components like this. We can create a library of shared ui elements (small, pure components) and use them everywhere,
  - `LESS` - as a CSS pre-processor. Simpler & faster styling process.
  - `react-chartjs-2` library - as a charts library in my project. It's a small wrapper for `chart js` library which contains lots of useful and customizable features.
